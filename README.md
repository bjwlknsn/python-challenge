# PyBank
A Python script that analyzes the financial records of a company. The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. The script calculates the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average change in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file to an already established folder called 'analysis' with the results.

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

The script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file to an already extablished folder called 'analysis' with the results.
